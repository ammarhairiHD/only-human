This project is created to raise awareness about bullying, with the main goal of bringing justice to its victims. It also serves as a testing ground for us as a cute junior software engineer at GNU.
I plan to build it using the same tech stack trusted by our experienced and beloved seniors at GNU:

1.Next.js

2.Payload

3.MYDS

4.GraphQL

5.MongoDB

6.Tinybird

For deployment, I’m starting with a serverless setup on Vercel. In the future, if the project proves successful, I’ll migrate it to AWS—where many of our seniors excel in cloud solutions.
